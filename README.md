# Kirk's Home on the Githubz

Welcome!  This is Kirk's home on Github - a one stop-shop where you can learn about what I do, what I believe, what I'm learning, what I'm working on, and all that good stuff.  For a good high level overview of my career, [my LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirkagray/) is a great place to start.

I'm a leader, and I still do some architecture, and every so often I write software.  I work at [McGraw-Hill Education](https://mheducation.com), where I am a Vice President of Engineering.  I work on fun ed-tech problems with a bunch of really great folks, and in my role, I get to deliver software to K-12, Higher Education, and Professional markets.  The breadth of problems we're attacking is really fun and rewarding.  

I have lived in Colorado since 2009, after growing up in Arlington, VA and living in and around Washington DC.  I'm a graduate of James Madison University, where I earned a BBA with a double major in Computer Information Systems and Economics.  Go Dukes!

I do presentations sometimes.  I've spoken at a number of company events, and last year I spoke at the [Develop Denver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8ma8tHrHCk) conference about how engineers can get more serious about managing their career and managing up.  I've also spoken at meetups (EdTech Denver, Boston Angular).  I find that I can best organize my thoughts using Powerpoint, so I have decks...lots and lots of decks.

Other things about me:

- I'm a lucky husband to a wonderful wife.
- I'm a dad to two awesome little dudes.
- I love playing sports, enjoying the great outdoors and working out.
- I [read](reading.md) a lot!
- I play guitar infrequently and extremely badly
- I used to brew beer pretty often, but now I specialize in drinking it, preferably at new breweries, wherever I find myself.
